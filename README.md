# 100 Days of Swift

In this repository, I will share my progress in learning Swift. The Challenge was created by [Paul Hudson](https://twitter.com/twostraws "Paul's twitter account") the owner of [Hacking With Swift](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/ "The Website Of Hacking With Swift"). However, I took the challenge further by simultaneously learning from another resource a book made by The Big Nerd Ranch ["Swift Programming: The Big Nerd Ranch Guide, Third Edition"](https://bignerdranch.com/blog/now-available-swift-programming-the-big-nerd-ranch-guide-third-edition/ "The Book's website"). Both of these resources have the same curriculum but the book is more detailed. I hope the 100 days will be great days ðŸ˜ƒ. Wish Me Luck.
